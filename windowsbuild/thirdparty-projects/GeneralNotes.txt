Notes from my build of TPL with VS 2017.

Jpeg 9b
Open VS command prompt
Copy jconfig.vc to jconfig.h
set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsfot SDKs\WIndows\v7.1A\Include
nmake /f makefile.vc nodebug=1 jpeg.lib
(I modify makefile.vx to build jpeg.lib instead of libjpeg.lib)

zlib 1.2.11
Use cmake build system

szip 2.1.1
Use cmake build system


Python 2.7.14
Use my notes. + 
Lib\distutils\msvc9compiler.py file in python needed to be updated to correctly find and call vcvarsall for vs 2017 community (professional might need different changes) 

PIL (Imaging 1.1.7)
_imaging.c needed change: '_expand' to '__expand' to prevent name collision with Windows sdk.

HDF5 1.8.19
Need to define H5_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB for all hdf5 dependent libs like
CGNS
SILO


CGNS
Modified cmakelists.txt to strip out static (no way to disable), and to add
add_defintions(-DH5_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB)

GDAL 2.2.2
modify nmake.opt, use nmake to build/install

hdf 4.2.13
use cmake build system

Netcdf 4.5.0
Use cmake build system
before first configure, create and fill in
HDF5_C_LIBRARY filepath to hdf5.lib
HDF5_HL_LIBRARY file path to hdf5_hl.lib
HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR path to hdf5 include
HAVE_HDF5_H filepath to hdf5.h
configure
will prompt for ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR and ZLIB_LIBRARY
turn off all DAP and TEST vars.


BoxLib (ccse-1.3.5)
See instructions in this dir.


VTK
Use the modified files and CMakeCache.txt 'seed' file found in
the CMake-seed-caches directory.

MESA
Needed for systems that don't support the correct version of opengl (3.2).
I followed the directions for building Mesa3D found here:
https://wiki.qt.io/MesaLlvmpipe
A copy of which is in the Mesa-17.3.0 directory.
See notes there.
