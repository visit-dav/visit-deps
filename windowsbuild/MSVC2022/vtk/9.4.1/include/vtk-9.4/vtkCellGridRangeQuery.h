 * @class   vtkCellGridRangeQuery
 * @brief   Compute the range of a component of some vtkCellAttribute.
 *
 * If \a FiniteRange is true, then the range will omit any NaN or ±Inf
 * values present in the data. Otherwise (the default), the range may
 * contain these exceptional values.
 *
 * If \a Component is
 * + -2 (the default), the range of L₂-norms is computed.
 * + -1, the range of L₁-norms is computed.
 * + out of bounds, then an invalid range will be returned ([1, 0]).
 *
 * Note that this query is intended to be run by vtkCellGrid::GetRange()
 * since the cell-grid holds a cache of ranges. You may run it outside
 * of this method, but that may cause unnecessary re-computation of ranges.
