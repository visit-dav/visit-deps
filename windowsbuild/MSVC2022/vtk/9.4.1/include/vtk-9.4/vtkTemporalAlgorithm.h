 * @class   vtkTemporalAlgorithm
 * @brief   Base class for temporal algorithms
 *
 * `vtkTemporalAlgorithm` is a class to template over a subclass of `vtkAlgorithm`.
 * It effectively implements `RequestData`, which, depending on the request,
 * will call `Initialize`, `Execute' and / or `Finalize`. Algorithms subclassing
 * `vtkTemporalAlgorithm` should provide a temporal cache that on which to accumulate
 * data in order to provide a complete output upon calling `Finalize`.
 * This algorithm class assumes temporal integration over input port 0, connection 0.
 * Time steps are gathered from its input information, and `UPDATE_TIME_STEP()` requests
 * are propagated to this input connection only. Filters taking multiple time series as inputs
 * should probably not inherit from this class.
 *
 * This class of algorithm handles 2 types of temporal integration, controlled by the member
 * `IntegrateFullTimeSeries`:
 * * When turned ON, integration is performed over the entire input time series for any requested,
 *   time step. effectively removing the temporalness of the outputs.
 * * When turned OFF, the output remains temporal. It is the result of integrating all time steps
 *   up to the time step requested downstream by `UPDATE_TIME_STEP()`.
 *
 * In any case, this algorithm will request all necessary time steps upstream in order to generate
 * the output, in chronological order, setting the information key `CONTINUE_EXECUTING()`. The
 * executive of this filter will iterate over all time requests until the output is generating.
 * `Initialize` will be called if the requested time step is more ancient than the last generated
 * time step. Then, at each iteration, `Execute` is called. Finally, when the last needed iteration
 * has completed, `Finalize` is called.
 *
 * There are cases where the user does not have access to the entire time series at once. This
 * compromises filters that have `IntegrateFullTimeSeries` ON, and which rely on knowledge provided
 * by the information key `TIME_STEPS()`. The implementation of this algorithm provides a specal
 * mode for such circumstences. All the user needs to do is set the information key
 * `NO_PRIOR_TEMPORAL_ACCESS()` in the sources.
 * If the information key `NO_PRIOR_TEMPORAL_ACCESS()` is set on the first input on port 0,
 * then this class will assume that the user is requesing time
 * steps in chronological order using `UpdateTimeStep(double)` and will provide a complete
 * output at each temporal iteration. Effectively, at each iteration, `Execute` and `Finalize` are
 * called. `Initialize` is called at the first iteration, or when `NO_PRIOR_TEMPORAL_ACCESS()` is
 * set to `vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::NO_PRIOR_TEMPORAL_ACCESS_RESET`. Processed time steps
 * are gathered in an array added to the field data of the outputs. The name of this array is
 * `time_steps` and can be retrieved through the method `TimeStepsArrayName()`.
 *
 * @warning Python wrapping of subclasses require special handling. Here is an example
 * ensuring wrapping works as expected,
 * implementing a temporal algorithm as a `vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm`:
 *
 * ```
 * #include <vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm.h>
 * #include <vtkTemporalAlgorithm.h>
 *
 * #ifndef __VTK_WRAP__
 * #define vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm vtkTemporalAlgorithm<vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm>
 * #endif
 *
 * // We make the wrapper think that we inherit from vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm
 * class MyTemporalFilter : vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm
 * {
 * public:
 *   vtkTypeMacro(MyTemporalFilter, vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm);
 *
 * // We do not need to trick the wrapper with the superclass name anymore
 * #ifndef __VTK_WRAP__
 * #undef vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm
 * #endif
 *
 * // We didn't wrap the non-overridden API of vtkTemporalAlgorithm. We define
 * // the missing API using this macro
 * #if defined(__VTK_WRAP__) || defined(__WRAP_GCCXML)
 *   vtkCreateWrappedTemporalAlgorithmInterface();
 * #endif
 *
 * // ...
 * };
 * ```
